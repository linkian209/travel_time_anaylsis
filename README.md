# Travel Time Analysis
I travel a lot for work. I wanted to get a good way to track how much time I am spending out of town. We track out of town hours by indiciating a (5) or (6) on our timesheet. Thus entered python!

This parses through the timesheet Excel file and grabs all the records that indicate travel. Then it compiles it into an annual report and stores it into another Excel file. This results (as it is called in the script) file becomes a record and the script appends new years to the same file as you run it.
